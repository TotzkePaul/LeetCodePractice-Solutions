## Strategies and Techniques

### 1. Tree Traversal

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
**When to use:** When you need to explore all paths to leaf nodes or when the problem involves backtracking.

**Variants:**
- In-order (Binary Trees): Left -> Root -> Right
- Pre-order: Root -> Left -> Right
- Post-order: Left -> Right -> Root

**Example Problem:** Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def inorderTraversal(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return
        dfs(node.left)
        result.append(node.val)
        dfs(node.right)
    
    result = []
    dfs(root)
    return result
```

**Why it works:** DFS explores each branch to its full depth before backtracking, which is ideal for problems requiring complete path exploration.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**When to use:** When you need to process nodes level by level or find the shortest path in an unweighted tree.

**Example Problem:** Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

```python
from collections import deque

def levelOrder(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([(root, 0)])
    
    while queue:
        node, level = queue.popleft()
        
        if len(result) == level:
            result.append([])
        
        result[level].append(node.val)
        
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, level + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, level + 1))
    
    return result
```

**Why it works:** BFS processes nodes in order of their distance from the root, making it ideal for level-wise operations.

### 2. Tree Construction and Manipulation

#### Recursive Construction
**When to use:** When building a tree from a given traversal or when the tree structure follows a recursive pattern.

**Example Problem:** Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

```python
def buildTree(preorder, inorder):
    if not preorder or not inorder:
        return None
    
    root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
    mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])
    
    root.left = buildTree(preorder[1:mid+1], inorder[:mid])
    root.right = buildTree(preorder[mid+1:], inorder[mid+1:])
    
    return root
```

**Why it works:** The recursive approach leverages the properties of preorder (root first) and inorder (left-root-right) traversals to construct the tree.

### 3. Path Finding and Summation

#### Path Sum
**When to use:** When you need to find paths with specific properties (e.g., sum to a target value, maximum sum).

**Example Problem:** Path Sum II (find all root-to-leaf paths that sum to a target)

```python
def pathSum(root, targetSum):
    def dfs(node, currSum, path):
        if not node:
            return
        
        currSum += node.val
        path.append(node.val)
        
        if not node.left and not node.right and currSum == targetSum:
            result.append(list(path))
        else:
            dfs(node.left, currSum, path)
            dfs(node.right, currSum, path)
        
        path.pop()
    
    result = []
    dfs(root, 0, [])
    return result
```

**Why it works:** DFS with backtracking allows us to explore all paths while maintaining the current path and sum.

### 4. Tree Properties and Validation

#### Recursive Validation
**When to use:** When checking if a tree satisfies certain properties (e.g., is it a BST, is it balanced).

**Example Problem:** Validate Binary Search Tree

```python
def isValidBST(root):
    def validate(node, low, high):
        if not node:
            return True
        if node.val <= low or node.val >= high:
            return False
        return validate(node.left, low, node.val) and validate(node.right, node.val, high)
    
    return validate(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

**Why it works:** By passing down the valid range for each subtree, we can efficiently check if each node satisfies the BST property.

### 5. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

#### Recursive LCA Finding
**When to use:** When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree.

**Example Problem:** Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q):
    if not root or root == p or root == q:
        return root
    
    left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    
    if left and right:
        return root
    return left if left else right
```

**Why it works:** The recursive approach finds the nodes and returns the LCA when both nodes are found in different subtrees.

### 6. Serialization and Deserialization

#### Level-order Serialization
**When to use:** When you need to convert a tree to a string representation and back.

**Example Problem:** Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        if not root:
            return "null"
        
        queue = deque([root])
        result = []
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append("null")
        
        return ",".join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        if data == "null":
            return None
        
        nodes = data.split(",")
        root = TreeNode(int(nodes[0]))
        queue = deque([root])
        i = 1
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if nodes[i] != "null":
                node.left = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            i += 1
            if nodes[i] != "null":
                node.right = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            i += 1
        
        return root
```

**Why it works:** Level-order traversal allows us to capture the structure of the tree, including null nodes, which can be reconstructed during deserialization.

## General Tips for Tree Problems

1. **Choose the right traversal:** Different problems may be better suited to different traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order, or level-order).

2. **Use recursive and iterative approaches:** Understand both recursive and iterative solutions, as some problems may have more efficient iterative solutions.

3. **Global variables vs. return values:** Consider whether using global variables or passing and returning values is more appropriate for the problem.

4. **Handle edge cases:** Always consider edge cases such as empty trees, trees with only one node, and unbalanced trees.

5. **Optimize space:** For problems involving large trees, consider solutions that use constant extra space (e.g., Morris Traversal for in-order traversal).

6. **Leverage BST properties:** For problems involving Binary Search Trees, use their ordered nature to optimize solutions.

7. **Use helper functions:** Break down complex problems into smaller helper functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

Remember, tree problems often have elegant recursive solutions, but it's important to consider the space complexity of the call stack for very deep trees. In such cases, iterative solutions with explicit stacks might be preferable.
